# Github 'astsam' Method


# install DKMS
sudo apt-get install dkms

* i recommend creating a new file for the driver, eg; mkdir /etc/network-adapters before gitcloning in to folder

#  download drivers from github
git clone -b v5.6.4.2 https://github.com/aircrack-ng/rtl8812au.git

# cd to file path of driver
cd /etc/network-adapters/rtl8812au  (or whatever directory you gitcloned the drivers to....)

# install driver
sudo make dkms_install

# remove driver
sudo make dkms_remove

# build & install the driver
make && make install

# check alpha interface is now showing

# In addition, if you receive an error message about unrecognized command line option ‘-mgeneral-regs-only’ (i.e., Raspbian Buster), you will need to run the following commands for ARM architecture, then retry building and installing:

$ export ARCH=arm
$ sed -i 's/^MAKE="/MAKE="ARCH=arm\ /' dkms.conf
Or, for ARM64 run the following before re-building:

$ export ARCH=arm64
$ sed -i 's/^MAKE="/MAKE="ARCH=arm64\ /' dkms.conf
